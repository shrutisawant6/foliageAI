Project Foliage, is here to help us turn breathless planet or any natural disasters into a thing of the past! 

By boosting green spaces, 
- we’ll make cities more resilient 🏙️🌿
- lower insurance claims 💰
- create jobs 🤝 and 
- even improve mental health. 🧠 

With tracking tree coverage and greenery changes, we'll soon be living in lush, eco-friendly paradises. Who knew saving the planet could also save money and make you feel good? Let's make the future greener, healthier, and a lot more fun—one tree at a time!

**How does it work:**
- By using Near-Infrared and Red images(satellite images) of any city or town, we can calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a value that indicates the level of greenery in the area. This helps assess whether the city requires improvements in vegetation.
- The system can be further developed to track NDVI values over time for each location, allowing comparisons with newer data to detect any decline and identify areas that need attention.
